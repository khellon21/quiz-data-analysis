### Task 1: Hashing

**Reminder Deliverable:** Is your `salted-data.csv` in this repository?

Answer the following in this file:

* How many unique users are in the data?
  - 42

* How many salts did you create?
  - 42
  
* How many possible combinations will I need to try to figure out the secret ID
  of all students (assume I know all potential secret IDs and have your 
  `salted-data.csv`)
  - 1764 
  
* Instead of salts, if you were to use a nonce (unique number for each hashed
  field) how many possible combinations would I need to try?
  
* Given the above, if this quiz data were *actual* class data, say for example
  your final exam, how would you store this dataset?  Why?

```bash
please put any cool bash one-liners or other piped commands you
learned/struggled with for task 1 here
```
